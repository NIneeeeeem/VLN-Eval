    Expand the given PIL image to a square shape by adding padding.

    - pil_img: The PIL image to be expanded.

    - The expanded PIL image.

    If the image is already square, it is returned as is.
    If the image is wider than it is tall, padding is added to the top and bottom.
    If the image is taller than it is wide, padding is added to the left and right.
